        <h2>Hello! My name is Louis.</h2><br>
        <p>I am pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at the <a href="https://www.ncst.edu.ph/" target="_blank" class="ncst">National College of Science and Technology</a>, fueled by an increasing enthusiasm for technology, resolving issues, and ongoing education. At present, I am concentrating on front-end web development, mainly utilizing <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, in addition to having explored the basics of <strong>C++</strong>. As I advance in my academic journey, I intend to enhance my knowledge of programming, system design, and different facets of computer engineering.</p><br><br>
        <p>In addition to my studies, I have a deep love for <strong>music</strong> and <strong>singing</strong>, which plays a vital role in my life. Whether I’m enjoying music, performing, or discovering new musical genres, I consider it an excellent means of creative expression. Moreover, I like to push my boundaries with logic puzzles like the Rubik’s Cube, which helps improve my analytical and problem-solving abilities.</p><br><br>
        <p>In my spare time, I also take pleasure in playing video games, especially Genshin Impact and Valorant, which I have recently begun to explore. Gaming, similar to coding, demands strategic thinking, patience, and flexibility—qualities I find beneficial in various aspects of life. I have a strong desire to acquire new knowledge, whether in technology, gaming, music, or any other field that piques my interest. My aim is to keep progressing, develop new skills, and utilize my knowledge in ways that meaningfully enhance both my personal and professional journeys.</p>
